# Heart-x-ray-mixed-model

The data comes from a study on observer error in assessment of heart x-rays conducted at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. 
The *diagnostic ratio* was calculated from heart x-rays taken by 2 randomly selected obervers on 2 random occasions presented to the 
observers in a random order. 
The purpose of the study was to investigate the variability in the assesments made by different observers.

This analysis uses the lme4 package in R to implement mixed models.
